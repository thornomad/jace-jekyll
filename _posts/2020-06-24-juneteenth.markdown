I will explain about Juneteenth. Juneteenth has two words put together, one word says “June,” and another word says “nineteenth”. June 19, 1865, in Galveston, was the last announcement that slavery was over. That is why most black people celebrate every June 19 to honor their freedom from slavery.
First, when the civil war was going to end, President Abraham Lincoln announced that slavery was over. Even though the Confederates lost the war, slave owners didn’t tell the slaves that slavery was over because they wanted to keep their slaves. The soldiers came to many states to announce that all slaves were free. The last place that soldiers came to was Galveston in Texas, on June 19, 1865. Two years later, all slaves were finally free!
 Second, many slaves were shocked and thrilled when they announced that slavery was gone! Some former slaves left and looked for their families that they were separated from. They walked to other states to find their families. Some former slaves wanted to stay and find employment. 
Third, every year black people celebrate Juneteenth on June nineteenth. What does the celebration look like? Black people like to have BBQs, go fishing, drink strawberry soda pops, share prayers, invite guest presenters, and more. 
Many white people in USA don’t know what Juneteenth means. That is why I write this essay so you can learn more about Juneteenth. If your family, friends, and girlfriend/boyfriend don’t know what Juneteenth means, please share this information with them too.
