  &lt;p&gt;Share this information to your family if your family don’t know what Juneteenth is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will explain about Juneteenth. Juneteenth has two words put together, one word says “June,” and another word says “nineteenth”. June 19, 1865, in Galveston, was the last announcement that slavery was over. That is why most black people celebrate every June 19 to honor their freedom from slavery.
First, when the civil war was going to end, President Abraham Lincoln announced that slavery was over. Even though the Confederates lost the war, slave owners didn’t tell the slaves that slavery was over because they wanted to keep their slaves. The soldiers came to many states to announce that all slaves were free. The last place that soldiers came to was Galveston in Texas, on June 19, 1865. Two years later, all slaves were finally free!
 Second, many slaves were shocked and thrilled when they announced that slavery was gone! Some former slaves left and looked for their families that they were separated from. They walked to other states to find their families. Some former slaves wanted to stay and find employment. 
Third, every year black people celebrate Juneteenth on June nineteenth. What does the celebration look like? Black people like to have BBQs, go fishing, drink strawberry soda pops, share prayers, invite guest presenters, and more. 
Many white people in USA don’t know what Juneteenth means. That is why I write this essay so you can learn more about Juneteenth. If your family, friends, and girlfriend/boyfriend don’t know what Juneteenth means, please share this information with them too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="youtube" /><summary type="html">Share this information to your family if your family don’t know what Juneteenth is.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Giant Person Ever!!!</title><link href="https://www.jacetimm.com/youtube/2020/06/02/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Giant Person Ever!!!" /><published>2020-06-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-06-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.jacetimm.com/youtube/2020/06/02/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.jacetimm.com/youtube/2020/06/02/welcome-to-jekyll.html">&lt;p&gt;This story is part one of “The day I shrunk” let you know.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Just let you know, this letter is for my grandparents so… some sentence is talking about grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Nana &amp;amp; Grandpa,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I will explain about a cool robot called Micro:Bit. I will tell you what Micro:Bit looks like, what Micro:Bit can feel, and some more information about Micro:Bit. In my opinion, I suggest you to buy Micro:Bit because it will help your life like it did help mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Micro:Bit is pretty small and light. Also, Micro:Bit has twenty-five dots of red lights and two buttons on the front. There are five holes in the bottom that can be used for music! Micro:Bit has tiny and gold electric bumps on it. Micro:Bit needs a battery to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Micro:Bit can sense many different things. Micro:Bit can sense the door closed and open. Micro:Bit can count seconds by itself. Micro:Bit can feel the temperature inside and outside. Micro:Bit can even count the steps too! You may wonder how Micro:Bit can feel the door close and open. Micro:Bit can feel the magnet. So, the magnet needs to be put on the top of the door, and the Micro:Bit needs to be put on the wall to sync the magnet. That’s how the Micro:Bit can feel the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the company, BBC, invented Micro:Bit. Micro:Bit is available to purchase online right now! Micro:Bit cost just $14.95-$18.00. Micro:Bit already has two batteries included in it, but you need to use a laptop to plug the Micro:Bit to transfer to your Micro:Bit to a laptop. Then, you can code it with your laptop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why will your lives be better with Micro:Bit? Because it can tell you when the door is closed or open. It can tell you the temperature. That is why I keep on saying, “it makes your lives better!”. I think you should try coding Micro:Bit. Thank you for buying me Micro:Bit for my birthday! I really enjoy playing with Micro:Bit.&lt;/p&gt;
